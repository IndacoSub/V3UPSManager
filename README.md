# V3UPSManager

A tool that allows you to easily mod "Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony", as long as the mod (you wish to install) is providing you the necessary .ups files.

For example, it allows you to install the unofficial Italian translation!

It supports both the "Legacy" (Steam) version and the "Anniversary Edition" (Switch) version.

We'd also like to support the Xbox (Microsoft Store, Anniversary Edition) version, but due to our limited technical knowledge about .arc (ARC0) files, we cannot support it.

Note: this program will NOT handle conflicts between files!

For example, if two mods need to edit the same file, then that file might get overwritten, and the mod(s) might not work correctly!
